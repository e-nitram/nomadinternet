            "title": "What are some options for improving my rural North Dakota internet speed?",
            "content": "<p>One option to consider is switching to a fixed wireless internet provider like Nomad Internet. Nomad offers plans with speeds up to 200 Mbps and a starting price of $99 per month (with a yearly plan). Rural areas in North Dakota may have fewer options for internet providers due to the high cost of infrastructure, so fixed wireless internet may be a good solution.<br\/><br\/>In addition to switching providers, optimizing your existing internet setup can also help improve your speed. Make sure your modem and router are up-to-date and placed in an open area away from walls or other obstructions. You can also try using a Wi-Fi extender to boost your signal if your internet connection is weak in certain areas of your home.<br\/><br\/>Overall, if you're experiencing slow internet speeds in rural North Dakota, it's worth considering switching to a provider like Nomad Internet that specializes in providing high-speed internet to rural areas. Their modems, such as the Nomad Air and Nomad Cube, can also help boost your signal for a more stable and fast internet connection.<\/p>"
