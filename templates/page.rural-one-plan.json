            "text": "I recently found out about Nomad Internet, and I’m so glad I did! As a rural resident of Idaho, I know thar finding best internet providers in my area can be difficult. But with Nomad, getting fast internet for my home has been a breeze. For the first time ever, my kids are able to get their online education without any hiccups. Plus, even though Sparklight and TekFinity were cheaper than Nomad’s monthly service fee, the dependability and speed that comes with Nomad make it invaluable! Definitely recommend if you live in a rural area!",
