            "content": "<p>If you live in a rural area of New Hampshire and are looking to improve your internet speed, there are a few options to consider. First, you may want to check with your current internet provider to see if there are any upgrades or options available to improve your connection. If not, you may want to consider switching to a fixed wireless internet provider, which can offer faster speeds than DSL or dial-up connections.<br\/><br\/>One option to consider is Nomad Internet, which offers internet speeds of up to 200 Mbps and a starting price of $99 per month (with an annual plan). Rural areas of New Hampshire can often have limited options for internet providers due to the high cost of infrastructure, but Nomad Internet aims to provide affordable high-speed wireless internet to all rural residents.<br\/><br\/>In addition to their internet service, Nomad Internet also offers modems such as the Nomad Air and Nomad Cube, which can help boost your signal and provide a more stable and reliable internet connection. However, it is important to note that not all modems are compatible with all internet providers, so be sure to check with Nomad Internet.<\/p>"
