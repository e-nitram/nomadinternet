We live in a rural area and previously had poor internet options with speeds that would rival a snail's crawl. After researching wireless broad band providers, we decided on nomad internet and couldn't be happier with the outcome. Not only did they manage to get us all up and running in just a few days without any fuss or interference, but the modem is lightning fast and always working perfectly - our whole family can now access high speed wireless internet with no more issues! All in all, we can't recommend nomad internet wireless broad band enough!",
