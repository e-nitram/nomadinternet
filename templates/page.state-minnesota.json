            "content": "<p>If you're looking to improve your internet speed in remote areas of Minnesota, there are several options to consider. One of the first things to consider is changing your rural internet provider. If your slow internet speed is due to your connection type, switching to a fixed wireless internet provider may offer faster speeds compared to DSL or dial-up internet service.<br\/><br\/>One provider to consider is Nomad Internet, which offers internet speeds up to 200 Mbps with a starting price of $99 per month (with a one-year plan). In rural areas of Minnesota, there may be fewer options for internet providers due to the high cost of infrastructure, but Nomad Internet aims to make high-speed wireless internet accessible for all rural residents.<\/p>"
