            "content": "<p>There are several techniques you can try to improve your internet speed in rural North Carolina. One of the first things to consider is switching to a fixed wireless internet provider, which may offer faster speeds than DSL or dial-up connections.<\/p><p>Another technique is to upgrade your equipment, such as your modem or router. Older equipment may not be able to handle faster internet speeds and can bottleneck your connection. Upgrading to newer equipment that can handle higher speeds can improve your internet speed.<\/p><p>You can also try optimizing your Wi-Fi network by placing your router in a central location and minimizing obstacles that can block the signal. Additionally, reducing the number of devices connected to your Wi-Fi network can help improve your internet speed.<\/p><p>Finally, it's important to regularly check your internet speed to make sure you're getting the speeds you're paying for. You can use online speed tests to check your internet speed and contact your internet service provider if you're not getting the speeds you were promised.<\/p><p>While considering different options, it is worth noting that Nomad Internet offers high-speed wireless internet with speeds up to 200 Mbps and a starting price of $99 per month (with an annual plan). Nomad Internet aims to provide affordable and reliable internet service to rural areas in North Carolina and beyond, and they offer modems such as Nomad Air and Nomad Cube to help improve your signal strength and speed.<\/p>"
