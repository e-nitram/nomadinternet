            "content": "<p>Here are some ways to increase internet speed in rural parts of Oklahoma:<\/p><p><strong>Upgrade your plan<\/strong><br\/>If you are currently on a basic plan, consider upgrading to a faster plan offered by your internet service provider (ISP).<\/p><p><strong>Check your equipment<\/strong><br\/>Make sure your modem and router are up-to-date and in good working condition. Old equipment can slow down your internet speed, so consider upgrading if necessary.<\/p><p><strong>Optimize your Wi-Fi signa<\/strong><br\/>Place your router in a central location, away from other electronics and walls. You can also try using a Wi-Fi extender to boost the signal in areas of your home with weaker signal.<\/p><p><strong>Consider a fixed wireless internet provider<\/strong><br\/>Fixed wireless internet uses radio waves to transmit data, similar to cell phone towers. Companies like Nomad Internet offer high-speed fixed wireless internet service in rural areas of Oklahoma.<\/p><p><strong>Use a wired connection<\/strong><br\/>If possible, connect your computer or device directly to the modem with an Ethernet cable. Wired connections are generally faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi.<\/p><p>Remember, before making any changes, it's a good idea to test your current internet speed. This will give you a baseline to compare your speeds after making any improvements.<\/p>"
